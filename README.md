# 🛡️ 7000+ XSS Payloads Collection

Welcome to one of the most extensive collections of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) payloads available on GitHub. This repository contains over **7000 unique XSS payloads**, sourced, crafted, and curated from a variety of real-world cases, research papers, bug bounty reports, community contributions, and custom experimentation.

## 📁 About This Repository

This repo is a treasure trove for:

- 🔍 **Bug bounty hunters** looking to expand their testing arsenal
- 🛠️ **Security researchers** seeking to analyze or compare payload behavior
- 🧪 **Pentesters** who want quick access to proven and tested payloads
- 🎓 **Students** and learners studying web application security
- 🧑‍💻 **Developers** aiming to build more secure input sanitization mechanisms

Each payload is crafted or gathered with the intent of bypassing common filters, WAFs, and input sanitization techniques.

## 📦 Payload Categories

Payloads are organized across various dimensions, including:

- 🔤 HTML/JS context-specific payloads (e.g. `<script>`, `<img>`, `<svg>`)
- ⚙️ Event-based payloads (`onerror`, `onload`, etc.)
